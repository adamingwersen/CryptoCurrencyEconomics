<h4>Motivation</h4>

In 2008 Satashi Nakamoto published his influential paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", which proposed ideas on a distributed public ledger currency platform for cheap web-based money transfers - much like cash. Many other cryptocurrency platforms, so called altcoins, have sprouted since as a result of the open-source blockchain technology. Each of these has slightly different governance rules and thus a different monetary base - as well as uses and properties. These platforms, BitCoin in particular has been heavily critisized for instability and large fluctuations in dollar-value; this criticism is in place should be no means be ignored. Some volatility stem from news about the platform - publicity in a sense - other are the result of heavy speculations and large sell-offs. However; one critisism that does not hold is concerning the inherent instability of public ledger currency platforms and in particular BitCoin. BitCoin's monetary base is fixed; thus new coins are not issued; but rather gradually unlocked from a fixed total ammount of 21M. The BitCoins in circulation cannot be destroyed, but some users have succeding in losing them by e.g. forgetting the key.    

The addition of coins in the BitCoin regime come only as a result of "mining"; an activity which serves as the processing of transactions. Mining is conducted by acting as distributed networks of processing power to take care of transactions. The difficulty and thus processing time required depends on the number of miners connected to the network. The individuals or firms conducting these activites does not do this for free; a reward is given for conducting the necessary processing in order to lock down a single block in the blockchain. This incentivices the miners. The reward miners recieve, paid in bitcoins, is by construction diminishing; at the completion of X number of blocks, the reward for all miners is reduced to half. This rather fixed setup should result in static expectations to the amount of bitcoins, since the number of coins in circulation grows at an approximately fixed, diminishing rate. The transparency of this system was initially thought to result in a stable currency, eventually. As seen, the dollar-value of a BitCoin has been wildly fluctuating, and the occurence of, in terms of currrency, acceptable stability in the longer term, is yet to be observed. As is the case with most fiat money, the value is derived in the fact that agents trust the longevity, functionality and unversality of the currency.    

Naturally, many factors other than the rules of the system affect the price of a BitCoin, one [article](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep03415), published in December 2013, attempts at treating the BitCoin much like one would a financial asset with no underlying value. This proves useful, and a cointegrating relationship between the BitCoin price and frequency of search queries on Google and Wikipedia exists - the relationship is found to be bidirectional. In terms of cryptocurrencies, a lot has happened since 2013, and the dollar-value of BitCoins has somewhat stabilized. 2 years of additional data provides additional information, and by expanding the sample size, one might be able to strengthen or weaken to credibility of the approach taken by L. Kristoufek. Some of the most recent data collected may contain interesting relationship.

<h4>Problem Definition</h4>

To what extent can the price of cryptocurrency be explained by movements in user-interest? Does econometric dynamic modelling of time-series succeed in describing a significant relationship between the price of cryptocurrency and user-interst?
